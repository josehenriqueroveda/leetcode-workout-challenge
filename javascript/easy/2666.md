# 2666. Allow One Function Call

Given a function `fn`, return a new function that is identical to the original function except that it ensures `fn` is called at most once.

The first time the returned function is called, it should return the same result as `fn`.
Every subsequent time it is called, it should return `undefined`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c), calls = [[1,2,3],[2,3,6]]<br>
**Output:** [{"calls":1,"value":6}]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
const onceFn = once(fn);<br>
onceFn(1, 2, 3); // 6<br>
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called<br>

**Example 2:**

**Input:** fn = (a,b,c) => (a _ b _ c), calls = [[5,7,4],[2,3,6],[4,6,8]]<br>
**Output:** [{"calls":1,"value":140}]<br>
**Explanation:**<br>
const onceFn = once(fn);<br>
onceFn(5, 7, 4); // 140<br>
onceFn(2, 3, 6); // undefined, fn was not called<br>
onceFn(4, 6, 8); // undefined, fn was not called<br>

# Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @return {Function}
 */
var once = function (fn) {
  let called = false;
  let result;

  return function (...args) {
    if (!called) {
      called = true;
      result = fn(...args);
      return result;
    } else {
      return undefined;
    }
  };
};

/**
 * let fn = (a,b,c) => (a + b + c)
 * let onceFn = once(fn)
 *
 * onceFn(1,2,3); // 6
 * onceFn(2,3,6); // returns undefined without calling fn
 */
```
