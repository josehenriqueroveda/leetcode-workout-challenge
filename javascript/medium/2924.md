# 2924. Find Champion II

There are `n` teams numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in a tournament; each team is also a node in a **DAG**.

You are given the integer `n` and a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `edges` of length `m` representing the DAG, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is a directed edge from team `ui` to team `vi` in the graph.

A directed edge from `a` to `b` in the graph means that team `a` is stronger than team `b` and team `b` is weaker than team `a`.

Team `a` will be the champion of the tournament if there is no team `b` that is stronger than team `a`.

Return the team that will be the **champion** of the tournament if there is a unique champion, otherwise, return `-1`.

**Notes**

- A cycle is a series of nodes `a1, a2, ..., an, an+1` such that node `a1` is the same node as node `an+1`, the nodes `a1, a2, ..., an` are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node `ai` to node `ai+1` for every `i` in the range `[1, n]`.
- A DAG is a directed graph that does not have any cycle.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]] <br>
**Output:** 0<br>
**Explanation:** Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.<br>

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]<br>
**Output:** -1<br>
**Explanation:** Team 2 is weaker than team 0 and team 1. Team 3 is weaker than team 1. But team 1 and team 0 are not weaker than any other teams. So the answer is -1.

# Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @return {number}
 */
var findChampion = function (n, edges) {
  const inDegree = Array(n).fill(0);

  for (const [u, v] of edges) {
    inDegree[v]++;
  }

  let champ = -1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (inDegree[i] === 0) {
      if (champ !== -1) {
        return -1;
      }
      champ = i;
    }
  }
  return champ;
};
```
