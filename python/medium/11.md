# 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

_Return the maximum amount of water a container can store._

Notice that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]<br>
**Output:** 49<br>
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.<br>

**Example 2:**

**Input:** height = [1,1]<br>
**Output:** 1<br>

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while left < right:
            area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            max_area = max(max_area, area)

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return max_area
```
