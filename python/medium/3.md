# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcabcbb" <br>
**Output:** 3<br>

**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.<br>

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "pwwkew"<br>
**Output:** 3<br>

**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.<br>

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        seen = {}
        start = 0
        max_len = 0

        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if char in seen and start <= seen[char]:
                start = seen[char] + 1
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - start + 1)

            seen[char] = i

        return max_len


```
