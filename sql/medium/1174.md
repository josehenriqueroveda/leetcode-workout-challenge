# 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

Table `Delivery`:

```
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called **immediate**; otherwise, it is called **scheduled**.

The **first order** of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The result format is in the following example.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** <br>

Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+

**Output:** <br>

# Solution

```sql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
WITH FirstOrders AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
    FROM
        Delivery
    GROUP BY
        customer_id
),
ImmediateFirstOrders AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) AS immediate_count
    FROM
        Delivery d
    JOIN
        FirstOrders fo ON d.customer_id = fo.customer_id AND d.order_date = fo.first_order_date
    WHERE
        d.order_date = d.customer_pref_delivery_date
),
TotalFirstOrders AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_count
    FROM
        Delivery
)
SELECT
    ROUND(
        CASE
            WHEN (SELECT total_count FROM TotalFirstOrders) = 0 THEN 0.00
            ELSE (SELECT immediate_count FROM ImmediateFirstOrders) * 100.00 / (SELECT total_count FROM TotalFirstOrders)
        END,
        2
    ) AS immediate_percentage;
```
